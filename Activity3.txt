In order for view functions to be able to access the request object without passing the object 
as an argument, global contexts are used. Global request contexts enable the request object to be used
as if it was a global variable when in reality it is not a global variable. Instead, Flask makes 
the request object globally available to a thread without affecting the other threads. Flask also 
supports application contexts. Global application contexts provide a mechanism by which an 
application can temporarily store data while it handles a request. 

In order to access application and request global contexts, these contexts need to be pushed 
otherwise an error is generated.
